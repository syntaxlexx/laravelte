## About Laravelte

Laravelte is an entire webapp based on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) web application framework and [Svelte](https://svelte.com) frontend. The main goals of this project is to provide a quick way to get started with your projects.

It features:
- [All Laravel Features](https://laravel.com).
- Quick Frontend Scaffolding via [Svelte](https://svelte.com) via [Inertiajs](https://inertiajs.com). Svelte is extremely fast, and provides less boilerplate as compared to [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [React](https://react.com). 
- Different **Admin** and **User** dashboard support.
- CI/CD via [Github Actions](https://github.com/).
- [Laravel Actions](https://laravelactions.com/): Instead of creating controllers, jobs, listeners and so on, it allows you to create a PHP class that handles a specific task and run that class as anything you want.
- [Redis support](https://laravel.com/docs/queues) and Laravel Queues.
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Tooling:
- Vite
- pnpm
